`native` translates between numbers in fixed sizes and byte sequences in (host)
native endianess. Think of it as the missing convenience combination of
`bytes.Buffer` and `encoding/binary` for fixed size numbers (`uint8`, `uint16`,
`uint32`, and `uint64`).

Especially useful when dealing with
[netlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlink). And no need to manually unroll
`encoding/binary` interface calls depending on endianess at runtime.

For devcontainer instructions, please see the [section "DevContainer"
below](#devcontainer).

## DevContainer

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Do **not** use VSCode's "~~Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container
> Volume~~" command, as it is utterly broken by design, ignoring
> `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.

1. `git clone https://github.com/thediveo/enumflag`
2. in VSCode: Ctrl+Shift+P, "Dev Containers: Open Workspace in Container..."
3. select `enumflag.code-workspace` and off you go...
